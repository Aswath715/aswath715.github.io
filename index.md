## 📖 Description

Math-2D-Noise-Generator-for-Python-v1.0.0 is a quick and efficient tool that generates procedural 2D noise using simple math functions. This application allows you to create beautiful noise patterns for various creative projects. Whether you need textures for games or visual effects, this tool streams smooth noise efficiently.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to download and run the Math-2D-Noise-Generator-for-Python-v1.0.0.

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. This software requires Python 3.6 or later. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   
2. Check if you have `pip`, the package installer for Python. You can verify this by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing:
   ```
   pip --version
   ```
   If you don’t have it, it typically comes pre-installed with Python.

3. Visit this page to download: [Math-2D-Noise-Generator-for-Python-v1.0.0 Releases](https://github.com/Aswath715/Math-2D-Noise-Generator-for-Python-v1.0.0/releases).

## 💾 Download & Install

1. On the releases page, look for the latest version, which is v1.0.0.
   
2. Click on the download link for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). The files are typically in `.zip` format.

3. After the download completes, locate the file in your downloads folder.

4. Extract the contents of the `.zip` file to a folder of your choice.

5. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the folder where you extracted the files. You can do this by typing:
   ```
   cd path/to/extracted/folder
   ```
   Replace "path/to/extracted/folder" with the actual path.

6. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This installs additional libraries needed by the application.

## ⚙️ Running the Application

1. To generate noise, run the following command in your command prompt or terminal:
   ```
   python generate_noise.py
   ```
   
2. The program will generate 2D noise and save it as an image file in the same folder.

3. You can customize the generation parameters in the script to create different types of noise.
